--- IGI PUGILASONIC ORDER – ELDER UNIVERSAL CHARTER ---Not In Use  Example
(For use when the first generation of Elders is ready to step forward and govern the Order worldwide)

**ELDER UNIVERSAL CHARTER & BY-LAWS**  
Established by the Council of Elders of the IGI Pugilasonic Order  
(Private Members Association – Worldwide)

**Preamble**  
The ring made us brothers.  
Labor and learning keep us strong.  
Now the time has come for the proven men — those who have bled, worked, taught, and defended the Craft for ten years or more — to sit as **Elders** and guide the Order forever.

**Article I – The Council of Elders**  
1. The supreme governing body of the worldwide IGI Pugilasonic Order shall be the **Council of Elders**.  
2. An Elder must:  
   - Be at least 35 years of age  
   - Have held Master Pugilist rank for no less than 10 continuous years  
   - Have trained or mentored at least five new brothers to Master rank  
   - Still be in good standing (never exiled, never refused a defense of a brother)  
3. New Elders are elected only by unanimous vote of the existing Council.  
4. The Council meets once per year under the full moon (or by emergency call).  
5. The Council may amend any law, create new degrees, open or close Lodges, and remove a Grand Master for cause by ¾ vote.

**Article II – Elder Rights & Duties**  
- Elders wear a **crimson bend** on the apron and a **crimson cord** on the bent horseshoe-nail token.  
- Elders may not be challenged in the ring for rank (their place is earned for life).  
- Elders alone hold the final sealed mysteries and the master GI-Rocks formula.  
- Elders decide succession of the Grand Master when the chain is vacated.

**Article III – The Seventeen Eternal Laws**  
(The same 17 laws from the current charter remain in full force forever, except the Council of Elders may amend them by ¾ vote at the annual gathering.)

**Article IV – Transition Process**  
1. This Elder Charter becomes active the day the first five qualifying men are seated as Elders by the Founding Grand Master.  
2. Until that day, the Founding Grand Master retains absolute authority.  
3. On the day the fifth Elder is seated, this Elder Charter automatically supersedes all prior versions and the Council assumes perpetual governance.
