**IGI PUGILASONIC ORDER**  
Universal Charter & By-Laws  
(Private Members Association – Worldwide)

**Preamble**  
Wherever three men stand ready to fight for brotherhood, labor with their hands, and pursue knowledge, there the Order lives.  
Motto: “We fight because we are brothers – not because we were born so.”

**Article I – Name & Jurisdiction**  
1. Official Name: IGI Pugilasonic Order  
2. Jurisdiction: Worldwide – any three Masters may plant a new Lodge anywhere on earth.

**Article II – Degrees & Ranks**  
1. Entered Apprentice  
2. Fellow of the Craft  
3. Master Pugilist  
4. Sergeant-at-Arms (enforcer officer)  
5. Grand Master (current holder until fairly defeated or succeeded)

**Article III – The Seventeen Eternal Laws of the Pugilasonic Craft**  
(Engraved on steel, carried in every portable Lodge kit)

1. A brother is made in the ring – never born in a cradle, **unless you are blood of the Founding Grand Master**. Blood earns the right to stand at the altar from birth; all others must bleed or win their place.  
2. All quarrels end in the circle – never in the courts of outsiders.  
3. Bare knuckles or gloved – honor chooses.  
4. Mandatory blood/testing panel before every sanctioned event.  
5. GI-Rocks (Golden-Age Energy Formula) is the sole sanctioned performance compound; distributed only by Masters and Sergeants-at-Arms to active, clean, training members.  
6. Any illegal Schedule I/II substance (other than GI-Rocks) = immediate confiscation, law enforcement called, and Order discipline.  
7. Ten percent of every purse, gate, and stream belongs to the Order.  
8. The true signs, grips, and words are never written nor spoken outside closed Lodge.  
9. A brother’s family, property, and name are sacred – defend them without hesitation.  
10. **Labor is sacred** – every brother must work with his hands or mind; idleness is dishonor. A man who will not work shall not eat at the Lodge table.  
11. **Stealing from a brother or the Order is unforgivable** – first offense: public apology + full restitution + 90 lashes (or equivalent labor). Second offense: permanent exile and mark of the thief branded on the left hand.  
12. **Lifelong learning is the Pugilasonic way** – pursuit of knowledge is voluntary but celebrated.  
13. **Educational achievement earns rank and reward**:  
   - Trade certification / apprenticeship → silver bend on apron + $500 bounty  
   - Associate’s or bachelor’s degree → gold bend on apron + $1,000 bounty  
   - Master’s or higher → automatic Master Pugilist title (if not held) + lifetime 5% bonus on all purses  
14. The Lodge library and online training vault are free to every working, training brother.  
15. What begins staged becomes real as the brotherhood perfects itself.  
16. Aid a fallen brother before counting cost.  
17. What a man sows, he reaps – the Pugilasonic ensures delivery by righteous means.

**Article IV–VIII** (unchanged – portable temple, revenue splits, full-moon amendments, etc.)

Sealed and updated this 28th day of November, 2025
